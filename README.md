# GS1
The official GameStation 1 repository on Github.

This github isn't for keeping the GameStation 1 updated, but to keep it preserved and easily available.

That being said, if you would like to release software for GS1, nobody will stop you. And you'll be able to put the game on a disk under any name and the GS1 will accept it. So the GS1 is now an open console, free of licenses. This also means any unauthorized hacking and cracking of software is now authorized and you are completely allowed to hack your GameStation, along with developing unofficial software in any form.
